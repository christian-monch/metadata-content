title: Cortical Surface Freesurfer


description: |
  "High-resolution structural images were used to generate the cortical
   surfaces using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, freely available at
   http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu, [Dale et al., 1999]). Additional
   high-resolution T2w images were included in the reconstruction
   (recon-all -T2 t2file).

   The surface quality was checked by inspecting the slice screenshots
   of QATool (v1.1, freely available at
   http://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools). The QATool was adopted
   to take sreenshots of the high-resoluton pial surface."
