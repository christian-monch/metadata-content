  description:
    "High-resolution structural images were used to generate the cortical surfaces
     using FreeSurfer (v5.3.0, freely available at http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu,
     [Dale et al., 1999]). Additional high-resolution T2w images were included
     in the reconstruction (recon-all -T2 t2file).

     The surface quality was checked by inspecting the slice screenshots of QATool
     (v1.1, freely available at http://ftp.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools, [no
     source paper linked]). The QATool was adopted to take sreenshots of the
     high-resoluton pial surface."
