  description:
    "Extension of the dataset published in Hanke et al.
     (2014; doi:10.1038/sdata.2014.3) with additional acquisitions for 6
     of the original 20 participants (and one additional participant).
     Participants performed a central fixation task while being
     stimulated with oriented gratings. The experiment was repeated in
     four different sessions with 7T BOLD fMRI acquisition, each with a
     different scan resolution (0.8, 1.4, 2.0, and 3.0 mm).

     This research was supported by a grant from the German Research
     Foundation (DFG) awarded to S. Pollmann and O. Speck (DFG PO 548/15-1).
     This research was, in part, also supported by the German Federal
     Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of a US-German
     collaboration in computational neuroscience (CRCNS), co-funded by the
     BMBF and the US National Science Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1112; NSF 1129855).
     Work on the data-sharing technology employed for this research was
     supported by US-German CRCNS project, co-funded by the BMBF and the US
     National Science Foundation (BMBF 01GQ1411; NSF 1429999)."
